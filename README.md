Buy me a coffee! Creating this kind of things is tedious sometimes and enjoyable also. When you support a developer, you really make it to work a lot happier 😄

### Roadmap

### Disclaimer
Real-Time usage scenarios (like a voice assistant for example) requires a GPU with at least 2-4~ gb of vram. The more the vram, the largest the model you can load, the better the transcription and the slower it gets.
